## About the Project:

#### There are two problem statements that we are trying to solve here:

1. Unorganised Ration Delivery: Currently we have an unorganised way of providing necessary food items like ration kit or        meals. Some area get meals thrice in a day whereas other not able to get it for a single time.
2. Overcrowded Shops: Currently people are not aware that which medical shop has least crowd + have  availability of masks/      sanitizers.

#### Solution:

1. Unorganised Ration Delivery:
   a. We are developing a web interface + android app to register all Organisations/ NGOs/ Volunteers who wants to help and         provide them the best location and path to provide their service.
   b. It helps Govt. authority to help in fulfilling need of someone as soon as possible by	nearest such bodies and prevent         overlapping of interested areas of such bodies.
   
2. Overcrowded Shops: 
   a. We used google map API to get nearest and least crowded shop. 
   b. Further there is a database to store infantry available at each shops, which will parse with the nearest shop queried         by user.
